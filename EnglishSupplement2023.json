        "lyrics": "1. Oh to see the dawn\nOf the darkest day\nChrist on the road to Calvary\nTried by sinful men Tom and beaten then\nNailed to a cross of wood\n\nThis the power of the cross\nChrist became sin for us\nTook the blame bore the wrath\nWe stand forgiven at the cross\n\n2. Oh to see the pain\nWritten on Your face\nBearing the awesome weight of sin\nEvery bitter thought\nEvery evil deed\nCrowning Your bloodstained brow\n\n3. Now the daylight flees\nNow the ground beneath\nQuakes as it's Maker bows His head\nCurtain torn in two\nDead are raised to life\nFinished the victory cry\n\n4. Oh to see my name\nWritten in the wounds\nFor through Your suffering I am free\nDeath is crushed to death\nLife is mine to live\nWon through Your selfless love\n\nThis the power of the cross\nSon of God slain for us\nWhat a love what a cost\nWe stand forgiven at the cross",

        "lyrics": "1. Even though I walk through the valley\nOf the shadow of death\nYour perfect love is casting out fear\nAnd even when I'm caught in the middle\nOf the storms of this life\nI won't tum back I know You are near\nAnd I will fear no evil\nFor my God is with me\nAnd if my God is with me\nWhom then shall I fear (2)\n\nOh no You never let go\nThrough the calm and through the storm\nOh no You never let go\nIn every high and every low\nOh no You never let go\nLord You never let go of me\n\n2. And I can see a light that is coming\nFor the heart that holds on\nA glorious light beyond all compare\nAnd there will be an end to these troubles\nBut until that day comes\nWe'll live to know You here on the earth",
